# SkyRL-v2 (fleet-ai/SkyRL-v2)

Fork of SkyRL with Fleet-specific optimizations for multi-node FSDP2 training at scale.

## Fleet Integration

Fleet-specific changes, fixes, and context are documented in:
- **[integrations/fleet/CHANGELOG.md](integrations/fleet/CHANGELOG.md)** — detailed changelog with root causes and fixes

Always consult the changelog before modifying Fleet training paths (`fsdp_worker.py`, `worker.py`, `model_wrapper.py`, `dispatch.py`, `fleet-*.sh`).

## Key Differences from Upstream SkyRL

1. **Multi-node FSDP2 stability**: Synchronous ref model offload/backload with `torch.distributed.barrier()` in `fsdp_worker.py`. Required because cross-node colocated training has no shared CUDA context.

2. **Chunked lm_head forward**: `model_wrapper.py` has `loss_chunk_size` support ported from the old fork. Avoids materializing full `(B, S, vocab_size)` logits — critical for 35B with 131K vocab at 97K sequence length. Without it, OOM/Xid 31 during training forward.

3. **CUDA memory management for 35B**: `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` before backward pass in `worker.py` (policy + critic). Prevents OOM from fragmentation.

4. **Reduced sequence length (72K) for 35B**: `fleet-35b-run.sh` uses `MAX_INPUT_LENGTH=72000` (down from 96000) with `--no-pytorch-alloc-conf` (disables `expandable_segments` which conflicts with vLLM 0.18.0's `CuMemAllocator`). At 97K, SDPA OOM'd and flash_attn hit Xid 31 in GatedDeltaNet. At 72K, flash_attn=true + chunked lm_head + empty_cache fits without expandable_segments.

5. **`stage_chunks` pre-staging**: `dispatch.py` has a `stage_chunks` optimization (not in upstream) that pre-stages mini-batch chunks in Ray object store. Includes dynamic `mini_batch_size` adjustment for hint augmentation's variable batch sizes.

## Training Scripts

- `scripts/fleet-common-run.sh` — shared infra (Ray, NCCL, gIB detection, deps). Used by all runs.
- `scripts/fleet-35b-run.sh` — Qwen3.5-35B config. Calls `fleet-common-run.sh`.
- `scripts/fleet-9b-run.sh` — Qwen3.5-9B config. Calls `fleet-common-run.sh`.

All training flags live in these scripts. Never duplicate flags in SkyPilot YAMLs or fleet-research scripts.

## Task-Gen Metrics

When reporting task-gen training metrics, distinguish between:
- **pass@8 / avg_raw_reward**: includes `base_quality=0.1` for passing sandbox+judge. Misleading — inflated by gate-passing alone.
- **binary variance reward**: the actual learning signal. `1.0` when solver rollouts are mixed (at least 1 pass + 1 fail), `0.0` otherwise. This is what matters.

Report binary variance reward count (how many tasks got `reward >= 1.0`) separately from gate-pass count. Check `EVAL` log lines for `total=1.0000` vs `total=0.0000`.
